# Code Documentation

Code documentation is text that accompanies software code to explain what your code is doing.

I have added explanations to some lines of codes where necessary to give explanation to what they do.

For instance:
#### HouseParms.Java
![](/docs/screenshots/code-1.jpg)

#### House.Java
![](/docs/screenshots/code-2.jpg)

#### index.js
![](/docs/screenshots/code-3.jpg)

## . and so on
